# Hello-World
This Is For The Early_Bird_Nation!
No one is as smart as you, and BTW thanks for the follow and subcribe ;-)
We are bringing everyone together.
A lot of programmers and developers can code but can't trade.
Alot of traders know how to trade but can't code.
We can do both, so we have decided to merge MQL4, MQL5, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Machine Learning into the mix.
But what are we talking about?

Most likely you really want to work for yourself, and want financial freedom right? How can you turbocharge and leverage your knowledge?
Share it and help build.


Alex Will teach trading methods on our youtube channel, but everyone might not be able to follow along, so let's build learning modules together with our own tools.


Contributors can help build earlybirdinvestmentsllc.com into
  1) Online Code editor (similar to brackets) for MQL4, MQL5, and javascript
  2) Online Teaching platform like Codecademy for MQL4, MQL5, and javascript
  3) Graphical Neural Network for trade analysis. (You will be suprised when we reveal the architectural design).
  
The main goal of the website is to take a person from not knowing how to code or trade and make them into a pro.
First go through the teaching platform. Then you can use the editor to code your own AI or EA.



This is the basic design of our new site coming up, it is your in hands to build. We will reveal design elements on youtube and trade functions. 

To maximize efficiency there is a design constraint on architecture, due to scientific, neurological, religion and ethics. If you don't have a grasp on neural nets or "real" AI. Just trust us on this, certain elements have to be a certain way. You'll see ;-)
Ok happy trading, building, and coding.
